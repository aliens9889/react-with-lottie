This project will mix Adobe After Effects + Lottie + React.

This is my first intent doing animations with Adobe After Effects

If you want to do animations and use it in a web development or mobile development. You can use **Bodymovin** it is an extension for Adobe After Effets that let you export an JSON file and use this file on your project.

Do you want to know how you could do that? Check this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8tInajwIHo) on Youtube from [Design Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow) If you like it you can subscribe.

[Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) is a library that allow you to render the animations you made from adobe after effects

To make this project works with React follow the steps from [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/add-animations-to-react-apps-with-react-lottie) it will help run the project correctly.
